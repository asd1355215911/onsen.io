For those that don't know what [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) is, don't worry, we can give you a fast overview. Brackets is an open source code editor developed by Adobe and released at the end of 2014. Its source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/brackets) and it's available for Linux, Mac and Windows. Because it's written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it's totally customizable.

The two main features of Brackets are:

* <div style="font-size: 20px">**Quick Edit**</div> Enables inline editing of CSS, Color Property, and JavaScript elements for developers. This built-in feature can be applied to multiple functions or properties simultaneously and all updates are applied directly to the file associated with the changed elements.

* <div style="font-size: 20px">**Live Preview**</div> Using it, Brackets pushes code edits instantly to the browser to present an updated page without having to reload.

So, what are you waiting for?! Try the extension and let us know what do you think about it!
